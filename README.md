# Client and Requirements
The client, The Gaming Room, wanted to expand their Android game Draw It or Lose It into a web-based version. The software needed to support multiple teams with unique names, run on desktops and mobile devices, and allow only one active game session at a time.

# What I Did Well
I did a good job organizing the document clearly and explaining the system structure. I provided details about the game requirements and the best platforms to use.

# What Helped in the Design Process
Writing the design document helped me plan everything I would need before coding. It made me think about the system’s needs and how everything should work together, which would make development smoother.

# What I Would Improve
If I could improve one part, I would add diagrams to the System Architecture section. This would make it easier to see how the parts of the game work together.

# Meeting User Needs
I made sure to focus on what the users needed, like supporting teams and players while keeping the game simple to use. It’s important to understand the user’s needs because it makes sure the software works well and makes users happy.

# Design Approach
I started by understanding the requirements and breaking down the design into smaller parts. I used the Singleton pattern to make sure only one game session runs at a time. In the future, I’ll continue using similar steps, like analyzing needs, creating a plan, and building a simple and scalable design.
